# Spotinsight

Spotinsight is a tool to view some stats of your spotify profile, I also decided to add a small spotify player. You can check out the live version at:
https://spotinsight.joriskorsten.nl/

To run the project yourself you should create an .env file and add the folowing attributes:
```
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URL=
VITE_SPOTIFY_AUTHORIZE=
```

After that you should be able to run the project with:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
